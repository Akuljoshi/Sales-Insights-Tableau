# Sales-Insights
The objective of the project was to create innovative and interactive Tableau dashboards that focus on revenue, profit, profit margin, and sales quantity for a hardware company called AtliQ Hardware. The client wanted to know the reason for the sales decline, where is the business failing, how to increase profit, were to increase production, and to get beneficial insights. The dataset provided by the client contains past data records of the company from all over India. The client insisted the data to be cleaned using tableau. The Dataset contained missing values and was cleaned using the tableau data cleaning. Tableau dashboards were created from the cleaned dataset.
